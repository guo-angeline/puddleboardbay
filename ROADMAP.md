## Strategy: what the data says

From the Jun 7 to 27, 2026 analytics (`reports/analytics-2026-06-27.md`, PostHog project 458289):

- **286 users, but 78% are one-and-done.** Next-day return 7%, W1 retention 13 to 17%. Acquisition is steady (~14 new/day); the problem is retention, not traffic.
- **Conditions is the differentiator.** The thesis holds: water is conditions-gated in a way hiking is not, so conditions is the wedge and the moat ("AllTrails for water", where dynamic conditions are the thing AllTrails can't do). But the old evidence was overstated: "96 users pulled conditions 1,157 times (~12 each)" was `conditions_viewed` firing on every spot open when the fetch settled, i.e. fetch-success-rate and spots-per-user, not confirmed looks. The defensible read is **conditions data loads reliably (~91% of opens)** — an availability metric. True engagement is now instrumented via a dwell-gated `conditions_viewed` (see `analytics/INSTRUMENTATION_CHANGELOG.md`, 2026-06-29); watch that series before re-asserting "used heavily".
- **Saving and installing were dead because they had no payoff** (favorites 6 users, PWA 1 install from 182 prompts). The fix is to make them the on-ramp to conditions.
- **Funnel leaks:** 247 landed, 105 opened a spot (58% bounce without opening anything), 15 took a real action. "Get Directions", the true "I'm going" signal, was clicked by 5 users in 20 days.
- **Growth is word-of-mouth, not search:** 82% direct, Google sent 10 users. The 140 SEO pages are too new to rank.

**Business model:** freemium "PaddlePass". Free = discovery + check conditions. Paid = conditions alerts for your spots + multi-day forecast windows + (later) offline. Conditions alerts are the natural paywall: high value, recurring, uniquely water.

## Shipped

- **Retention epic: conditions alerts (Stages A to D), shipped + live 2026-06-29.** Save a spot, install the app, get a capped daily web push when a watched spot has a calm window in the next 1 to 3 days. Stage A (Your Spots ranked by conditions), B (install/opt-in + service worker + push subscription), C (Supabase store + `/api/alerts/subscribe`), D (Vercel Cron watcher that sends). Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-27-retention-hook-design.md`; plans under `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-27-retention-hook-stage-{a,b,c,d}.md`.
  - **Unproven, watch the data before building more retention/premium:** opt-in grant rate (`alert_optin_result`), `alert_clicked`, and whether alerted users beat the 13 to 17% W1 baseline. As of 2026-07-01: 1 granted subscription (iOS standalone, 2026-06-30). **Re-check the save -> opt-in -> push -> return funnel around 2026-07-15 to 2026-07-22**; if saves are still ~2 users/week, fix the landing bounce (item 1) before iterating on alerts.
  - **Evaluator redesigned 2026-07-02:** the original day-period evaluator required the whole 6am to 6pm forecast max wind <= 8 mph, which never happens in SF Bay summer, so alerts could never fire. It now uses the NWS hourly forecast and alerts on >= 2 consecutive calm daytime hours (calm mornings count).
  - **Real-device test, remaining piece:** install + opt-in verified on a real iOS device 2026-06-30. Still owed: confirm the push actually lands and deep-links (next cron 13:00 UTC), and confirm the subscription row exists in Supabase (needs dashboard or CRON_SECRET dry-run: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" "https://paddletowater.com/api/cron/check-conditions?dry=1"`).
- **Instrumentation pass, shipped + live 2026-06-29.** `spot_viewed` now carries `source: "list" | "map" | "deeplink" | "alert" | "related"` (canonical `SpotViewedSource` in `lib/analytics.ts`), and `alert_clicked` fires when the app opens from a push (the service worker tags the deep link `from=alert`). Outbound on Get Directions / Share was deferred (the `spot_action` click already captures intent; true "the link left" detection is fuzzy and low value).

## 1. Fix the 58% landing bounce

142 of 247 visitors never open a single spot. On mobile (77% of users), surface value on load instead of a bare map: auto-open or prompt the nearest spot, or a "good to paddle near you today" view. Near-me works when asked, but nobody asks (10 users). Pairs naturally with the conditions data Stage A already fetches.

## 2. Make "Get Directions" convert

The true conversion, clicked by 5 users in 20 days. Either the button is buried in the drawer or wind is deterring trips. Test placement, and cross-tab directions clicks against calm-vs-breezy conditions to learn whether wind suppresses intent.

## 3. SEO: monitor, do not build yet

Organic is 10 users; expected this soon after the 140 spot pages went live. Recheck organic traffic in 4 to 6 weeks. If still flat, the spot pages are not indexing and that becomes a real work item. No build now.

## Tech follow-ups (from building the retention engine)

- **Bounded-concurrency NWS fetch** in the cron (`app/api/cron/check-conditions`): it does 2 serial NWS calls per unique watched spot, which approaches the 60s function limit as the watched set grows. Batch with bounded concurrency + cache the `/points -> forecast URL` resolution. Do before many spots are watched.
- **`npm audit fix`**: 4 moderate prod advisories (dompurify, postcss) pulled in transitively; the critical/high are dev-only.
- **UNIQUE `alert_sends` dedupe index + `ON CONFLICT`** for DB-level dedup (currently app-enforced via `sentKeys`).
- Restrict the cron's unique-spot fetch to spots reachable from an enabled subscription; sort the alert headline by soonest window.

---

## Later (after retention is proven)

- **UGC content flywheel:** ratings, photos, trip logs, user conditions reports. The long-term moat and SEO-acquisition engine, but it needs retained users to generate content first.
- **Optional Google sign-in** to sync push subscriptions and saved spots across devices (the engine ships anonymous; this is the upgrade path).
- **PaddlePass premium tier:** alerts + multi-day forecast windows + offline, as the freemium paywall.
- **Community spot submissions** with admin approval.
- **Tide-window refinement** in the cron's "good window" evaluator (it ships wind-only).
