# Decisions: the escalation inbox

The studio pauses escalation-worthy work and files it here. Answer by typing after `Answer:` on any entry; the next loop iteration ingests it and unblocks the gated items. Entries are append-only, newest last.

## D1 [OPEN] 2026-07-04 · Remaining item-5 cron/schema work: defer or approve?

Context: item 5's one safe sub-task (`npm audit fix`) shipped (PR #8, merged). The three remaining sub-tasks all touch protected surfaces, which `.claude/studio.md` says must escalate:
- **Bounded-concurrency NWS fetch** in `app/api/cron/check-conditions` (perf refactor of the alert-sending cron).
- **`alert_sends` UNIQUE index + ON CONFLICT** (schema migration on alert infrastructure).
- **Restrict the cron's fetch to enabled subscriptions + sort the headline by soonest window** (cron send behavior).

The bounded-concurrency refactor also has no benefit at current scale: there is 1 subscription, and the 60s-timeout risk it addresses only appears with many watched spots. It is pure risk to the path that wakes real users, for zero present gain.

Options:
- **(a) [recommended] Defer all three** until the watched set grows and the two experiments (alert-interstitial, next-good-window) have read out. The cron is load-bearing for the whole retention thesis; do not touch it for a speculative perf win while it works.
- **(b) Approve only the bounded-concurrency perf refactor now** (no change to what/when/who is sent), verified via the `?dry=1` endpoint before deploy.
- **(c) Approve the `alert_sends` UNIQUE-index migration now** (I write the migration + ON CONFLICT; applying it to the live DB stays a separate owner step).

Recommendation: (a). Get the two experiments live and reading, then revisit item 5 when scale actually justifies touching the cron.
